- **Verification**: ✅ Both endings now achievable

### 2. Integration Ending Balance - RESOLVED  
- **Problem**: Requirements too strict (Sanity ≥60, Investigation ≥50)
- **Impact**: Ending nearly impossible to achieve
- **Fix**: Reduced requirements to Sanity ≥50, Investigation ≥40
- **Verification**: ✅ Ending now achievable with reasonable effort

### 3. Ignorance Ending Unlock Conflict - RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Room (0,2) required Digital Nature ≥1 but ending needs ≤1
- **Impact**: Logical impossibility preventing ending
- **Fix**: Changed room requirement to Memory Fragments ≥1
- **Verification**: ✅ Ending now logically consistent and achievable
